Create a web app with the following functionalities:

1. Login / Signup
2. Manage profile [Name, password, email, phone, photo]
3. Upload documents [pdf / excel / csv]
4. Manage documents [delete / view contents (preview - should be able to view the documents within the webpage/iframe)]
5. Search across documents [scan the contents of doc and search. If the document is a scanned copy, would be good to use OCR]

Steps 1-4 should be demoed via a publicly accessible link and codebase shared via a github or zip

Step 5 can be demoed if possible, otherwise, they can explain the detailed approach of what tech/tools/architecture/workflow will be used to achieve the functionality.

React.js / Node.js can be used
